Angle of Elevation
***
Angle of Elevation(Theta):
The angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when an observer is
looking up at an object.
Formulas:
tan(Theta)= apposite side /adjacent side
In the context of angle of elevation, the "opposite side" is usually the 
height of the object being observed, and the "adjacent side" is the 
horizontal distance from the observer to the object.

cos(Theta)=adjacent/hypotenues
This is used if you know the horizontal distance and the
 distance along the line of sight.

sin(Theta)=apposite/hypotenuse 
This is useful if you know the height of the object and the distance along the
 line of sigh

A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground, which is 48m away from the foot of 
the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 30 degree . Find the height of the tower.

Construction
***
The angle of elevation is often used in scenarios like surveying land, calculating 
the height of objects, and in physics for problems involving projectile motion.
